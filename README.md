SETImap - tracks Seti@home datafiles and locate it on a skymap
==============================================================
SETImap project tracks work units (WU) of the Seti@home distributed client by Berkeley University (once it was a stand-alone application).
Each WU is a data captured by a radiotelescope (mainly Arecibo) from a certain point at the sky. SETImap stores sky coordinates, signal strength and other data so the user can see all processed units marked on the skymap.
See Versions.txt file to see version history.
